# UNP_Mastering_BI_with_Power_BI_HR_Attrition_Data
This repo contains the project completed during the Mastering Business Intelligence with Microsoft PowerBI Internship program with UNP Education, India.
# Project Overview:
Attrition refers to the gradual reduction of a workforce as employees retire or leave a company.

A HR Attrition Data from a company was shared to analyze the attrition rates and make business intelligent insights from it. The data contained 1470 rows and columns such as the age, gender, marital status, monthly income, departments, work life balance and so on about the employees of the company.

Analysis was performed on the dataset using the Microsoft PowerBI software. Employees analysis was performed to ascertain the distribution of the employees according to their gender, age, marital status, distance from home, level of education and consequently, an Employee Analysis Dashboard was developed to summarise the findings of the analysis.

Furthermore, Attrition analysis was performed on the HR Attrition data to determine the attrition rate and the distribution of the attrition within the various levels of the company. An Attrition Analysis Dashboard was developed to visualize the results.

The results from the analysis offers business intelligent insights for the company to adopt inorder to reduce the attrition rate and improve the overall satisfaction of her workforce.
